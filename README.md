# <Bootcamp Assignment One â€” Horiseon Code Refactor>
## Description
The goal of this assignment was to refactor an existing set of code to ensure that it is functioning properly, structured well, and meets accessibility standards. I built this project to get a stronger understanding of the importance of semantics and organization when coding. As noted in the assignment guide, refactoring existing code is a common task, so it's an important skill to develop and understand. 

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?


## Installation
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
