# Bootcamp Assignment One: Horiseon Code Refactor
## Description
The goal of this assignment was to refactor an existing set of code to ensure that it functions properly, reads well, and meets accessibility standards. I built this project to develop a stronger understanding of the importance of semantics and organization when coding. As noted in the assignment guide, refactoring code is a common task, and completing this project helped me to learn and practice how to better structure HTML and CSS files. 

## Process
I started by opening the provided HTML file in a browser to examine how the existing HTML and CSS were affecting the page. Next, I went through the HTML file and added notes to define the sections of the page content. Once I had a clear understanding of the HTML structure, I began changing all of the div elements to semantic elements. I was successfully able to replace all div elements with a more logical semantic element, which created a better document flow and structure. I also kept in mind that changing these elements (and sometimes removing any unnecessary classes or ids) could affect the CSS, so I made sure to update the corresponding CSS selectors while making changes to the HTML. I also added alt attributes to all img elements to improve accessibility.

Once the HTML document was in a good place, I moved on to improving the CSS file. My first step was to review the entire document and add comments noting what each CSS rule set defines. This step allowed me to identify redundant and unnecessary code while developing a clear understanding of each rule set's purpose. Next, I rearranged the rule sets to follow the flow of the page structure (and HTML file), making the CSS easier to read. With everything in logical order, I proceeded to consolidate the CSS structure by grouping elements with the same rules under a more gerenal selector that followed the improved HTML semantics. 

I made sure to constantly save my work and make note of the updates and changes along the way by frequently using the git add, git commit, and git push commands. I am pleased to see that after all the edits I made to the HTML and CSS, the site still looks just like the mock-up provided (no stylistic changes were applied) and that everything is functioning correctly, including the broken anchor link!

## Conclusion
Overall, I reallly enjoyed completing this assignment and feel like the practice of combing through an HTML document and CSS file really helped solidify all of the concepts we covered in the first week of class.
